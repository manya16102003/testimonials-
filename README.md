#The Testimonial App

Introduction
The Testimonial App is a simple React application designed to allow users to manage testimonials through a user-friendly interface.
This application showcases fundamental aspects of web development using React, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, 
state management, and component-based architecture. By working with this app, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to structure
a React application, manage component state, and handle user input.

Happy coding & Learning
